Questions
===============
* Explain Microservices Architecture
    - Microservice Architecture is an architectural development style which builds an application as a collection of small autonomous services developed for a business domain.

    - Letâ€™s take an example of e-commerce application developed with microservice architecture. In this Microservices architecture example, each microservice is focused on single business capability. Search, Rating & Review and Payment each have their instance (server) and communicate with each other.

* Name three commonly used tools for Microservices
    - Postman 
    - Docker
    - Hystrix are important Microservices tool.

* What is Monolithic Architecture?
    - Monolithic architecture is like a big container in which all the software components of an application are clubbed inside a single package.

* What are the advantages of microservices?
    - Technology diversity, e., Microservices can mix easily with other frameworks, libraries,  and databases
    - Fault isolation, e., a process failure should not bring the whole system down.
    - Greater support for smaller and parallel team
    - Independent deployment
    - Deployment time reduce

* What is Spring Cloud?
    - Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state). Coordination of distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns.

    - Spring Cloud focuses on providing good out of box experience for typical use cases and extensibility mechanism to cover others.

        - Distributed/versioned configuration
        - Service registration and discovery
        - Routing
        - Service-to-service calls
        - Load balancing
        - Circuit Breakers
        - Global locks
        - Leadership election and cluster state
        - Distributed messaging

* Discuss uses of reports and dashboards in the environment of Microservices
    - jsjReports and dashboards help in monitoring and upkeep of Microservices. Tons of Application Monitoring Tools assist in this.

* What are the challenges faced while using Microservices?
